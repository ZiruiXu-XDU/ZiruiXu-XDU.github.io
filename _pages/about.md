I am a first-year postgraduate student from [School of Electronic Engineering](https://see.xidian.edu.cn/), [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/). 
My research interest includes computer vision and machine learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Cheng Deng](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/chd) of OPTIC Lab from [School  of Electronic Engineering](https://see.xidian.edu.cn/), Xidian University.
